A renderer using Progressive Photon Mapping (PPM). [This page](https://umutcanemre.github.io/my-chlorinated-nightmare/) showcases some notable renders.

This was done as the self-directed final project for [CS 488](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Spring2024/) at the University of Waterloo. Source code for the project is not available as it uses some starter code from the course.
